Installation

Dependencies
------------

(up-to-date dependencies will always be in setup.py)

* Requests_ is the only external dependency on Python 2.6+
* If you are running Python 2.5, you will need to install simplejson_.
* Asynchronous operation requires gevent_ (which in turn requires greenlet and libevent) (If you are running Debian or Ubuntu the system package (python-gevent) is recommended as installing from source via pip may lead to segfaults, and nobody likes those.)
