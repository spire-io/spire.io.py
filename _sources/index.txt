Spire.io.py Documentation
=========================

Spire.io.py is a client library for the Spire.io_ platform. It can be used with
a Spire account key, or with just a URL and Capability provided by an
authorized client. The library uses Kenneth Reitz' excellent Requests_ library
under the hood, and like Requests, it supports evented (asynchronous)
networking with gevent / libevent.
