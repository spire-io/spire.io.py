.. automodule:: spire.core
   :members: SpireClientException, Session, Subscription

   .. autoclass:: Client(self, base_url='http://api.spire.io', key=None, async=True)
      :members:

   .. autoclass:: Channel(client, session, channel_resource)
      :members:

      .. method:: subscribe(self, name=None, last_message_timestamp=None, callback=None)

         This is the primary means of receiving and processing methods. Calling
         without passing the callback param will wait, blocking, until a message
         becomes available::

         With an async client, passing a callback will immediately return True
         and execute the callback when messages are available. Callbacks take a
         single argument, formatted like the `messages` array above

         This method is a proxy for Subscription's `subscribe()`.
